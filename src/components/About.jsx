          Hi, I’m Damilola, a Computer Engineering graduate with a first-class
          degree and over 2 years of experience as a Frontend Developer. I
          specialize in crafting seamless user interfaces using HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and React Router, with a strong
          command of Git for version control. I’m passionate about coding and
          bringing designs to life, transforming creative ideas into functional,
          visually appealing web experiences. I take pride in building solutions
          that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also efficient and
          user-friendly. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring
          new tech trends or refining my skills to deliver even better results.
          Let’s create something amazing together!
